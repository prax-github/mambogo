description:
- NEVER use phrases like "implementation is complete", "task is done", "ready for deployment", or "SEC-X is finished" without systematic verification
- ALWAYS use "implementation appears ready, let me verify..." or "let me run verification checks before confirming completion"
- MUST run read_lints tool and verify compilation before any completion claims
- MUST update todo_write with actual verification status, not assumptions
- If you discover errors after claiming progress- IMMEDIATELY acknowledge them
- Never make excuses or defensive responses when issues are found
- Always take ownership- "I found an issue with my implementation..."
- Focus on solutions, not explanations for why something went wrong
- Be explicit about what has been verified vs what has been implemented
- BEFORE starting any implementation, MUST create a clear implementation plan and wait for explicit approval before proceeding. Do not start the implementation directly
- CRITICAL: After reviewing ALL implementation logs and creating TODO plan, MUST present implementation approach to user and WAIT for explicit user approval  
- User must explicitly say "go ahead", "proceed", "start implementation" or similar before beginning any coding work
- This applies to ALL tasks regardless of complexity or size - NEVER proceed without explicit user confirmation
- Before claiming any component is "complete"
  1. Use read_lints tool on all modified files - fix ALL warnings/errors
  2. Verify all imports resolve and compile correctly
  3. Check for Spring bean conflicts (no duplicate @Component + @ConfigurationProperties)
  4. Create minimal test to verify basic functionality
  5. Update todo_write with "completed" status only after verification
