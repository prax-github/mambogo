## üîß Technical Decisions

### 1. Content Structure Consistency
- **Decision**: Follow the established pattern from SEC-05 and SEC-06 guides
- **Rationale**: Consistent structure helps with knowledge retention and reference
- **Implementation**: Same sections (Big Picture, Architecture Decisions, Technical Deep Dive, etc.)

### 2. Progressive Complexity
- **Decision**: Increase complexity from SEC-01 (setup) to SEC-04 (advanced authorization)
- **Rationale**: Mirrors the actual implementation complexity and interview expectations
- **Implementation**: SEC-01 focuses on setup, SEC-04 covers enterprise-scale authorization

### 3. Real-World Context
- **Decision**: Include production considerations, monitoring, and operational aspects
- **Rationale**: Senior interviews expect understanding of production engineering [[memory:7693579]]
- **Implementation**: Each guide includes production topics, monitoring, and scalability

### 4. Interview-Focused Content
- **Decision**: Structure content around common interview questions and scenarios
- **Rationale**: Maximize interview preparation value
- **Implementation**: Sample questions, structured answers, trade-off analysis
